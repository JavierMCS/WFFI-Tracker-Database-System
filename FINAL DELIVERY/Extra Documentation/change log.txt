Tracker Database Change Log
4/15/2018

-Logins to the database are now done automatically by checking the user's windows login
-Users can be more easily added, removed, and edited in the admin menu
-The Woodbridge Group logo has been added to database forms. It can be globally changed, and should
	keep its formatting if changed.
-The "Maxi", "Mini", and "Slitter" tables all have updated versions with better data formats
-The "Maxi" forms and reports have been updated to work with the updated "Maxi" table
-Audit tables have been added
-Audit tables trigger from user logins and data deletions
-A development tool was created in the C# language which can split numbers in a text format and remove units


NOTE: we tried changing the forms and reports for the "Mini" and "Slitter" table, but had trouble saving them.
    they might be corrupt either due to being updated so many times, or going through so many updates
    of microsoft access. They seem to work currently, but are not tied to the updated "Mini" and "Slitter" tables.
